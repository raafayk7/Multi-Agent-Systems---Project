# Analyzing the Price of Anarchy in Green Routing: A Simulation-Based and Theoretical Approach
We analyze the Price of Anarchy behavior of a
selfish routing congestion game, which has the
aim of supplying each player’s demand through
a combination of ICEVs and EVs along different
routes, with the goal of minimizing each player’s
cost, which is a combination of the pollution
caused by ICEVs and the delay caused by charg-
ing the EVs. We analyze game’s behavior as an it-
erative projected gradient dynamics problem, also
known as SIRD, and analyze the PoA analysis by
varying the pollution cost. We find that within
appropriate ranges, as the value of pollution cost
increases, the Price of Anarchy decreases, sug-
gesting that either selfishly or globally, once pol-
lution cost increases too much, the optimal goal
would be to completely shift to EVs, after which
the problem therein becomes a problem of opti-
mizing the quadratic congestion cost of the EVs.
